# Project Design Plan overview

Phases:

1. Idea
  - Using brainstorm
  - As a result an idea should be generated

2. Planning
  - **Analyze** the alternatives & rivals **implementations**
  - Project requirements & define scope of work
    - A list of functionality divided to "**must have**" and "**nice to have**" features
    - The issues should be divided to high & low levels (work breakdown structure)
    - All issue's childs should be estimated (in hours, or story points)
  - Wireframes
    - Should include **each page** of application
      - with relations between of them
      - with describe user interacting with page
    - Should cover a backend & other sides of application
    - The **UML use case diagram** should be provider (\w userflow)
    - The **PDF document** should be provided & **shared** at the end of this phase
  - **Responsibilities** of each team player?
    - Assign all issues to each team member
  - The **specification document** should be produced & **shared** at the end of this phase

3. Architecture
  - What **technologies** you're planning to use?
  - Where data will be stored?
    - Database structure if relation database will be used
    - The UML diagram
  - The directory stucture of application is created
  - **Code convention** is approved with each team player
    - Naming of variables/functions? UPPERCASE? lowercase? camelCase? underscode_case? etc?
    - And stored to some shared space
  - What **methodologies/tools** for management will be used?
    - Methodology?
      - [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum)
      - [Kanban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVXZUaWhYw)
      - [ScrumBan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaNHFsFz7Yw)

    - Tool for reporting & synchronization?
      - [Trello](https://trello.com/)
      - [Asana](https://asana.com/)
      - [Google Spreadsheets](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)
      - etc
  - **Code workflow** is agreed with each team player
    - Git flow?
      - Branches for each feature?
      - How offen to merge to/from master?
    - Commit messages?
    - A list of rules should be stored to some shared space
  - What **primary tool** for communication will be used?
    - Skype group chat? Slack? Email? Nothing?
  - **Reporting** & synchronizing?
    - Kickoff meeting?
    - Daily **standups**?
    - Weekly internal demo? Do it more less/offen?

4. Development
  - An **empty repository is created** & provided access for each team player (test push/pull are working)
  - The initial empty **directory structure is pushed** to repo

5. Closing
  - Presentation
    - What presentation tools will be used? (Prezi? Google presentation?)
